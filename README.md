# ATM_OOP_Project
My first OOP project in C++ – a basic ATM system with user login and balance operations.
# ATM OOP Project (C++)

This is my first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project using C++.  
It simulates a simple ATM system with the following features:

## 💡 Features

- Create new user accounts with automatic ID
- Secure login with password masking
- Check balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance check)
- Reset password
- Input validation and clean user interaction

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++ (OOP: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
- `vector`, `string`, `limits`, and other STL headers
- Console input/output with `_getch()` for hidden password

## 📷 Sample Output (optional)
You can add screenshots here later.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `main.cpp` in any C++ IDE (like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks)
2. Compile and run
3. Use the menu to create an account or log in

## 🔖 Future Plans

- Add file saving/loading for user data
- Improve UI
- Handle multi-language support (English/Arabic)
